In the UK, the car market has increased steadily after the pandemic with around 600k electric cars now in the road, an increased from 100k in 2019 and  accounting for 2% of overall cars in the road. There are more electric cars than ever in the uk roads and this trend is likely to continue as consumers shift from diesel cars to less polluting cars.

### Electric cars now more popular than diesel cars
The shift in consumer behavior has been shiftly, in 2016 there was a complete dominance of petrol and diesel vehicles with a 50/50 split on the total number of cars but now diesel vehicles only account for less than 10% of new registrations and for the first time in 2021 there were more new registration of electric cars than diesel.

### Manufacturers offer greater choice to consumers

Cars manufactures now provide greater choice for consumers looking to move to electric and plug-in hybrid cars, fewer than 50 different models were registered in 2019. In contrast, more than 150 different models were registered in 2022, consumers now have more than three times more models available than in 2019 and policies requiring manufacturers to produce more than 80% of electric vehicles by 2030 will only increase the number of models available for consumers to choose from.

### Nearly half of electric cars are registered in Southern England

Southern England (South East, South West and London) have the highest number of electric and more than other parts of the UK with around three hundreed thousand cars registered in this region. Northern ireland, wales and the midlands are lagging behind other regions in the UK, with the lowest uptake of electric cars.

### Price is one of the barriers for consumers to stwich to electric cars

Regions with lower earnings have the lowest uptake of electric cars and reducing the cost of electric cars should be a priority in order to increase uptake in other regions in the uk. The average asking price of electric cars for volume brands such as Kia, Hyndai and Peugeut in December 2022 was 28k whereas petrol and diesel cars was around 17k (source:trade...). On average consumers will need to spend 10k more to buy an electric car. As more electric cars enter the use cars we should see the a decrease average price of electric cars and become for affordable for families across the UK.

### Electric chargers infrastructure is concetrated to London with around 35% of total chargers located in the capital
The total number of chargers in the UK have increased by 130% since 2019, with around 20k more chargers in 2022 than in 2019. The electric infrastructure has seen a largest increase in London and other parts of the south of England, 3 out 5 new charges have been installed in either London, South east or South west. Although, infrastructure has improved considerably more needs to be done to improve the infrastructure across the UK.

### Outlook
Electric cars are more popular than ever and uptake of electric cars has increased considerably in the last 3 years as consumers move away from diesel vehicles, consumers have a greater choice of electric car models and better charging infrastructure makes it more covinient to make the switch to electric. Price and electric chargers infracture pose a challenge to the industry with a big concentration of electric cars and chargers in the southern of england. In order for the goverment to meet their ambitious targets, electric cars need to become more affordable and the electric charger infrastructure needs to improve in regions outside southern of england.
