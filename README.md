In the UK, the car market has increased steadily after the pandemic with around now 600 hundred thousend  electic and plug in electric cars now in the road, accounting for around %2 of overall vehicles in the road.

The shift in consumer behavior has been shiftly in 2016 there a complete dominance of petrol and diesel vehicles with a 50/50 split on the total number of cars but now diesel vehicles only account for less than 10% of new registrations and for the first time in 2021 there were more new registration of electric cars than diesel.
